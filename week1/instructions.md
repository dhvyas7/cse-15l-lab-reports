First, open the terminal on your computer or install Visual Studio Code from its [website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Type in the following command:
ssh cs15lusername@ieng6.ucsd.edu 

The username can be found here: [](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)

When prompted to enter your password, enter your password which you have reset using the AD password change tool

You will then be logged into the remote server and your present working directory will be the same name as your CSE15L username. This is where you can run and test commands such as cd, ls etc.

Below is the screenshot of a screen similar to what you will see along with some sample commands:
